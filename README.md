## About JDev

Aspiring to become a full-stack developer, I am fueled by the dynamic nature of web development and the boundless possibilities it offers. I thrive on collaborating with like-minded professionals to brainstorm innovative features and discover robust solutions.

I specialize in front-end development, crafting pixel-perfect UIs that not only look good but also have features that elevate user experiences.

I have the legal right to work within the United Kingdom and The Netherlands. I'm open to exploring opportunities beyond these regions however a visa sponsorship will be required.

Beyond coding, I'm a dance and travel enthusiast. Exploring diverse cultures fuels my creativity, enriching my approach to web development.

Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!
