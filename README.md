## About JDev

Hey there! 👋 I'm Jonathan, a passionate Front End Web / Creative Developer with a flair for turning ideas into visually stunning digital experiences. With a solid foundation built over 4 years, I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and TypeScript, bringing web interfaces to life with seamless interactivity.

Always hungry for creative challenges, I've recently delved into the captivating worlds of Blender and Three.js. These tools have become my playground for pushing the boundaries of web development, allowing me to fuse my love for coding with the magic of animations.

Whether it's crafting pixel-perfect UIs or orchestrating captivating 3D visuals, I thrive on the intersection of technology and creativity. Join me on this exciting journey as I continue to explore new dimensions in the ever-evolving landscape of web development.

Let's build the future together, one line of code at a time!
